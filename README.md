# Geolocation-Based-Attendance-
This React Native app is designed for marking attendance, utilizing both geolocation and face recognition technology. The app uses the device's GPS to verify the user's location and then employs facial recognition software to verify the user's identity.

The backend for this app is built using the Flask framework, utilizing the Dlib library for facial recognition. The app provides a secure and convenient way for users to mark their attendance.

This app uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store its data. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which provides a flexible and scalable solution for data storage and retrieval.

# Build With
